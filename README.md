# UFO Sighting Prediction Web App ðŸš€

Welcome to the **UFO Sighting Prediction Web App**! This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the **country** of a UFO sighting based on input features: `seconds`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.

---

## ðŸŒŒ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to combine machine learning with web app development to create an interactive tool for UFO sighting predictions. This was an exciting challenge that helped bridge the gap between data science models and real-world applications.

The **model accuracy** achieved is **96%**, making it a reliable tool for predictions.

---

## ðŸ§° Features

- **Prediction**: Input UFO sighting details (seconds, latitude, longitude) and get the predicted country.
- **Interactive Web App**: User-friendly interface for easy interaction with the ML model.
- **High Accuracy**: The ML model has been trained to predict UFO sighting countries with precision.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing UFO sighting data, including:
- **Seconds**: Duration of the sighting.
- **Latitude & Longitude**: Coordinates of the sighting.
- **Country**: The target variable for prediction.

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing values were handled.
- Latitude and longitude were standardized.
- The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

---

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model

The machine learning pipeline includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Feature scaling and encoding.
2. **Model Training**: A classification model was trained using scikit-learn.
3. **Evaluation**: Achieved an accuracy of **96%** on the test set.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Web App Features

The web app is built using **Flask**, with:
- **HTML/CSS** for the front-end.
- **Python (Flask)** for the back-end integration with the ML model.

### How to Use the App
1. Enter the UFO sighting details:
   - Duration in seconds.
   - Latitude.
   - Longitude.
2. Click "Predict."
3. The app will display the predicted country of the UFO sighting.
